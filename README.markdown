ML-Projects
===========

These are some different projects I've done in the functional programming language ML while I was in school.

Most model different discrete mathematical concepts like groups, lattices, trees, etc...

I doubt everything works. I think most are syntactically correct, and most should work, though I haven't documented what example input looks like on each function. Perhaps you may find this useful, or at least intriguing.
